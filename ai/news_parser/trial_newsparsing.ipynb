A notable chunk of these shares was used as collateral to finance his purchase of Twitter, now known as X. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although details such as how many shares are pledged, the terms of his loan agreements, and the price point that could lead to a margin call haven\\'t been made public, the implications could be considerable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/03/44552785/why-elon-musk-may-regret-ignoring-warren-buffetts-political-strategy\">Why Elon Musk May Regret Ignoring Warren Buffett&#8217;s Political Strategy</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other tech giants also felt the heat on Friday, with&nbsp;<strong>Apple Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) down 7.29%,&nbsp;<strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) falling 7.36%,&nbsp;<strong>Amazon Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>) dropping 4.15%,&nbsp;<strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\">GOOGL</a>) decreasing 3.20%, and&nbsp;<strong>Meta Platforms Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>) down 5.06%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The significant drop in Tesla&#8217;s stock price is a clear indicator of the potential impact of political decisions on the stock market. The newly imposed tariffs have not only affected Tesla but also other tech giants, leading to a widespread market downturn. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This event underscores the vulnerability of tech companies to global political and economic shifts.

Instead, he reaffirmed his decision to raise tariffs in an effort to boost American manufacturing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t&nbsp;care less if they raise&nbsp;prices, because people are going&nbsp;to start buying American-made cars,&#8221; Trump stated&nbsp;in an interview <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-couldnt-care-less-automakers-raise-prices-tariffs-rcna198731\">with</a> NBC&nbsp;News. He further expressed his anticipation for price increases, which he believes will steer consumers towards American-made vehicles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Earlier this week, Trump declared a 25% tariff on foreign-made cars and auto parts, set to take effect from April 2.

This could potentially fuel overall inflation. However, Trump pointed out that countries with &#8220;great value&#8221; resources might have room to negotiate lower prices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Despite some resistance from lawmakers, Trump is convinced that this move will bring long-term benefits for the U.S. This announcement has already triggered significant investments in American plants by foreign companies, including&nbsp;<strong>Apple Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Honda Motor Co., Ltd.</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/HMC#NYSE\">HMC</a>), and&nbsp;<strong>Hyundai Motor Company</strong>&nbsp;(KRX: 005380).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: This decision by the President could reshape the auto industry, potentially leading to a shift in consumer behavior towards American-made vehicles. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The move has already sparked investments from foreign companies in American manufacturing plants, indicating a possible boost to the domestic auto industry. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, the potential price hike and its impact on inflation will be a key factor to watch in the coming months.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Read Next</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/25/03/44346155/trumps-tesla-shoutout-falls-flat-no-spike-in-orders-or-inventory-movement\">Trump&#8217;s Tesla Shoutout Falls Flat — No Spike in Orders or Inventory Movement</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Image: Shutterstock</p>',\n",

Long-term data suggests that it is indeed an opportunity — but as a trader, timing matters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Following the close of the midweek session, President Donald Trump announced <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/04/44613907/tariff-shock-incoming-as-trump-prepares-sweeping-trade-duties-what-traders-need-to-know\">sweeping new trade tariffs</a>, an event he termed \"Liberation Day.\" The initiative is a symbolic push to tackle the ballooning U.S. trade deficit <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/tariffs\">with major global partners</a>. Unfortunately, the levies were steeper than analysts expected, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/04/44631916/wall-street-wipes-out-2-trillion-apple-eyes-worst-day-since-covid-19-pandemic-oil-plummets-whats-driving-markets-thursday\">sending shockwaves through global markets</a> on Thursday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even as the Street digested the news and the broader implications, one day of extreme volatility wasn\\'t enough, with Friday being subjected to another crimson tide. Prominent <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/market-summary/25/04/44643100/us-stocks-likely-to-open-lower-after-the-worst-selloff-since-2020-tariff-announcement-was-100-smoot-hawley-disguised-as-thoughtful-policy-says-expert\">experts voiced their displeasure</a> at the tariffs, warning about severe consequences stemming from decelerated economic activity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Still, amid the social media uproar, there was one point that stood out. Creative Planning Chief Market Strategist <strong>Charlie Bilello</strong> remarked that while the VIX or the so-called fear index reached its highest closing level since August 2024, the S&amp;P 500 has historically delivered \"higher than average\" returns following significant surges in volatility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since Apple stock is a benchmark security — leveraging a tremendous influence on both the tech ecosystem and the wider equities space — it stands to reason that its present volatility is a long-term buying opportunity. After all, one wouldn\\'t naturally expect a giant like Apple to be permanently deflated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a patient investor\\'s perspective, the red ink serves as a potential time machine — a chance to hop on the train that was previously missed. But from a trader\\'s perspective, diving into Applr stock now may not be the most prudent decision.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Death Cross in AAPL Stock is Warning First, Then Opportunity</strong></h1>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To be sure, opportunistic traders will find it difficult to avoid reacting greedily to the hemorrhaging. Adding to the contrarian fervor, Apple stock is on the absolute cusp of printing the dreaded <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/technicals/25/04/44629335/apple-stock-slammed-by-trump-tariffs-is-a-death-cross-next\">death cross</a> — a technical sign when a security\\'s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200 DMA.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On paper, the death cross represents a warning, marking the beginning of a serious downcycle or even an outright bear market. For many investors, it may symbolize the last chance to exit shares or take protective measures through advanced options strategies before further volatility erupts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, there\\'s also the contrarian thought process that when the death cross flashes, much (if not most) of the bad news has already been baked in. Therefore, it\\'s possible, if not likely, that the technical indicator could be a buying signal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here\\'s the thing about Apple stock: while its death cross statistically represents a compelling buying opportunity, in the near term, the indicator should be interpreted at <em>face value</em>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04150515/AAPL-stock-death-cross-returns-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-858378\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04150515/AAPL-stock-death-cross-returns-1024x576.jpg 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04150515/AAPL-stock-death-cross-returns-300x169.jpg 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04150515/AAPL-stock-death-cross-returns-768x432.jpg 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/04150515/AAPL-stock-death-cross-returns.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image by author</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More specifically, over the past decade, Apple stock printed five death crosses. Sure enough, three months to one year removed from this negative intersection, Apple has swung higher across these time intervals four out of five times (or 80%). However, at the one-month mark following the death cross, Apple has only risen one time — meaning that the failure rate pops to 80%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a statistical wide angle, it\\'s difficult to analyze how Apple stock will respond given that extreme volatility is rare. Right now, the equity is on the verge of losing about 12% in the trailing five sessions. The last time Apple lost double-digit percentage points in a one-week period was in April 2016.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Pulling up a historical chart, one can see that the volatile event that took place a decade ago took several months to recover. And that\\'s the lesson the death cross is broadcasting: yes, it is a buying opportunity but not right now.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Switch Hitting for the Agnostic Trader</strong></h1>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Being a successful trader requires not being married to a specific direction and that\\'s the opportunity available in Apple stock. With the current flashing of the death cross likely to result in near-term volatility, aggressive traders may first want to consider the 195/190 bear put spread for the options chain expiring May 2.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The above transaction involves buying the $195 put (at a time-of-writing ask of $1,225) and simultaneously selling the $190 put (at a bid of $970). Subsequently, the proceeds from the short put partially offset the debit paid for the long put, resulting in a net cash outlay of $255.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Should Apple fall to or below the short strike price at expiration, the maximum reward is the difference between the strike prices (multiplied by 100 shares) minus the cash outlay or $245 (a payout of 96%). This trade plays off the fact that the average one-month loss (assuming only the negative scenario) following the death cross is 1.06%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For long-side traders, patience may be required. One compelling idea that stands out is the 215/220 bull call spread for the options chain expiring July 18. This trade plays on the rebound effect of the death cross while also respecting the time component. Executing this trade requires buying the $215 call and simultaneously selling the $220 call, with the aim that Apple will hit this latter price at expiration.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>',\n",

The carnage has erased trillions of dollars in paper wealth, hammering retirement accounts, mutual funds, and 401(k) balances across the country.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It\\'s DeepSeek, Not Tariffs, Bessent Claims</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bessent insists the real trigger was not Trump\\'s universal tariff plan but a reassessment of U.S. tech valuations following China\\'s DeepSeek AI breakthrough. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In his words, the sell-off \"started with DeepSeek,\" suggesting that Wall Street had priced in AI dominance prematurely and is now correcting that assumption.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\"This isn\\'t about tariffs, it\\'s about a dose of reality in the AI space.\"</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bessent Defends Tariff Revolution</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;This is transformational for the American economy, the American worker, and the new Republican alignment,\" Bessent said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bessent didn\\'t shy away from defending the economic rationale. He cited new MIT research showing that the Trump administration\\'s original 20% tariffs on China only lifted U.S. prices by 0.7%, suggesting that foreign producers absorbed much of the impact.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bessent emphasized that tariffs are about more than just economics—they&#8217;re about security. \"Economic security is national security,\" he said, referencing COVID-19 as a wake-up call that exposed the fragility of global supply chains.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p> \"We don\\'t make our own medicine, our own chips, or our own ships,\" Bessent noted, advocating for reshoring critical industries to prevent strategic vulnerabilities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The administration\\'s long-term strategy, according to Bessent, is to use tariffs as a bridge: boost revenue in the short run while incentivizing companies to build domestically, thereby reducing the need for tariffs altogether. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\"First, we collect. Then, we build. Then, the tariffs drop—but revenue from taxes and jobs goes up.\"</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pushing to get the tax bill done so we can guarantee the low taxes,&#8221; he added. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bessent dismissed the threat of retaliation from global trading partners, indicating that surplus nations like China and Germany are in no position to strike back effectively.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\"We are the debtor nation. We have the trade deficits. The surplus nation is in the weaker position,\" Bessent said, asserting that China\\'s economic model—heavily reliant on exports—is \"the most unbalanced in the history of the modern world.\"</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\"I think President Trump has broken their business model with these tariffs,\" he said. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\"They [China] can\\'t survive without it [the surplus].\"</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\"I think the Europeans are going to have to rebalance, too,\" he noted, pointing to Germany\\'s overdependence on exports and expensive energy policies as unsustainable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Reactions</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stocks deepened their decline in afternoon trading in New York, with investors finding little comfort from either fiscal or monetary leaders. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Earlier in the day, Fed Chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> reaffirmed that the central bank is in a strong position and sees no urgency to begin cutting interest rates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 index – as tracked by the<strong> SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) – is down 5%, on track for its worst day in five years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 – tracked by the<strong> Invesco QQQ Trust</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ\">QQQ</a>) – sunk 5.1%, eyeing its worst day since March 2020.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Within Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla fell 9.8%, followed by Nvidia&#8217;s 7.2% decline.  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Read now: </strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/04/44648681/powell-cites-tariff-driven-inflation-risks-shrugs-off-trumps-call-for-perfect-time-to-cut-rates\">Powell Says It&#8217;s &#8216;Too Soon To Say&#8217; On Rates As Tariffs &#8216;Likely To Raise Inflation&#8217;</a></strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Photo: Maxim Elramsisy/Shutterstock</em></p>',\n",
